**Terraform with Vault Integration**

This is a sample project demonstrating the integration of Terraform with Vault for managing authentication, secrets, and policies for various teams.

**How to Test the Integration**
Follow the steps below to test the Terraform configuration with your Vault server.

**Prerequisites**
1. Vault server is set up and accessible.
2. Terraform is installed on your machine.

**Steps to Test**
Clone the repository (if applicable):
`git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terraform-vault.git
cd terraform-vault`


Create a terraform.tfvars file: In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and create the terraform.tfvars file to store the Vault root token.


touch terraform.tfvars
Paste your Vault root token: Open the terraform.tfvars file and paste the Vault server root token as shown below:

hcl
Copy
Edit
dev_server1_token = "YOUR_VAULT_SERVER_ROOT_TOKEN"
Run Terraform to apply the configuration: After saving the changes, run the following Terraform command to apply the configuration:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform apply -auto-approve
This command will:

Authenticate with Vault using the root token provided.
Create the necessary paths for the teams (e.g., devops_team1, infra_team1).
Set up user accounts for the teams.
Enable secret engines for storing team-specific secrets.
Apply policies to manage access to secrets.
Verifying the Integration
Check Vault: Log into your Vault server and check if the paths, users, and policies were created correctly.
Check Secrets: Ensure that secrets have been stored under the designated paths (e.g., kvv2_devops_team1).
Test Authentication: Use the Vault UI or CLI to test authentication using the user accounts created by Terraform.
Example Output
After running terraform apply, you should see output similar to this:

bash
Copy
Edit
vault_auth_backend.devops_team1: Creation complete after 3s [id=devops_team1]
vault_generic_endpoint.devops_team1_user01: Creation complete after 2s [id=auth/devops_team1/users/devopsteam1]
vault_kv_secret_v2.aws_devrole_team1_secrets: Creation complete after 1s [id=kvv2_devops_team1/aws_master_devrole_team1]
...
Cleanup
To remove the resources created by Terraform, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy -auto-approve
